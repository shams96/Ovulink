This is a placeholder for the adaptive-icon.png file.

You need to create a 1024x1024 pixel PNG image file named "adaptive-icon.png" in this directory.
The adaptive icon should use the Ovulink branding colors:
- Primary color: #FF6B8B (pink)
- Secondary color: #7C83FD (blue)

This will be used as the app's adaptive icon for Android devices.
