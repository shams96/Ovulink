This is a placeholder for the favicon.png file.

You need to create a 196x196 pixel PNG image file named "favicon.png" in this directory.
The favicon should use the Ovulink branding colors:
- Primary color: #FF6B8B (pink)
- Secondary color: #7C83FD (blue)

For testing purposes, you can use any online favicon generator to create a simple icon.
