This is a placeholder for the splash.png file.

You need to create a 2048x2048 pixel PNG image file named "splash.png" in this directory.
The splash screen should use the Ovulink branding colors:
- Primary color: #FF6B8B (pink)
- Secondary color: #7C83FD (blue)

This will be used as the app's splash screen that appears when the app is loading.
